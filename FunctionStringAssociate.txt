
"Function String Associate"
===============================================================================
An IDA Pro plug-in that comments functions by the strings it contains
Version 1.7

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the chaos of a 10,000+ function target et al.., this plug-in can help
reversing by extracting various "assert" and other (variables, constants, etc.)
strings; making some sense of it all by adding info as a function comment for
browsing.
As you browse around at a glance these comments might tell you to a greater or
lessor degree what a particular function might do, what area it belongs to,
etc.

In some targets there are tons of these useful strings, on others very few if
any at all. Thus the information will either be great or little to nothing.

-- [Install] ------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy the plug-in to your IDA Pro "plugins" folder.
Edit your "plugins.cfg" with a hotkey to run.

Example:
"FunctionStringAssociate IDA_FunctionStringAssociate_PlugIn.plw Alt-6 0"

See official IDA docs for more help on on installing and configuring plug-ins.


-- [How to run it] ------------------------------------------------------------
Just invoke it using your selected IDA hot-key or from "Edit->Plugins" menu.


-- [How it works] -------------------------------------------------------------
Iterates every function in the loaded IDB; In each function iterates it's
elements looking for string references; Then sorts these with some assumptions
about relevance and places them as a function comment.
